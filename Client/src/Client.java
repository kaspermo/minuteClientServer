 * The program assumes that nanoseconds have been omitted before the original LocalDateTime was hashed.

 * HtmlFile path can be exchanged if desired
 * Url can be exchanged with another url if desired, this should however match with the url of the server posting
 * X can be exchanged for another int to increase or decrease the possible random delay between fetches (currently set to at least once a minute)
